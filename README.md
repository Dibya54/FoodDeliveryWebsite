FoodDeliveryWebsite is a full-stack Java web application that simulates the workflow of modern food delivery platforms such as Zomato and Swiggy. The project demonstrates a complete end-to-end implementation of a scalable web system â€” covering user authentication, restaurant discovery, menu management, cart functionality, and order placement â€” all wrapped in a responsive UI.
